Team Members: Zachary Fader, Jackson Antoluv, and Conner Evans

Purpose of Project: To create a fun and engaging card game based on Marvel heroes and villains. 

Tools utilized: Visual Studio Code, Github, Figma, css, Procreate, and the Marvel API

Problems and how we overcame them: 
Our first problem faced was the scale of our project. Once we dialed back our ambitions and focused on what we knew we could manage to achieve in the weekend.
Our second issue arose in learning how to use the tools available to us to make the game we had in mind. Two of us had never used HTML before so it was a great learning experience for us.
Finally, we had a lot of problems with implementation and balancing to try to make a game that is not only working demo of a larger idea but also fun experience on its own.
